# Task Board

### Project Description - This project is based on created a task board that keeps track of current things todo. It allows you to create a todo card and then transfer that card between "Todo", "In Progress" and "Done". Depending on the date that you selected for due date in the modal, you will receive feedback from the chart in the form of color codes. The color yellow means you are close to the due date while the color red notifies you that you are overdue and need to get that task completed.
